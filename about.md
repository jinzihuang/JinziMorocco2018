I am a software developer with 8 years of experience in developing IBM products and 
applications. 
I am honored to be a member of IBM CSC Morocco13 team and wish to take this greate oppertunity to help local communities solving their problems and promote IBM culture throughout the world. I am looking forward to meet and cooperate with other passionate IBMers, broaden my skillset and approach problems from different perspectives.
On free time I enjoy reading, running, painting and traveling.
