Muruli, John and I are formed sub-team-1! Muruli Nataraju is an advisory software engineer from IBM Systems Organization (Bangalore, IN) who has great experiences in IBM Power Firmware system. John Lin is a Data Scientist from IBM Watson Health (Cleveland, US), and he has amazing skills in big data analyst and data mining. I am a staff software developer from IBM Security Organization (Toronto, CA), and currently working as a web developer for [IBM Security Guardium Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/guardium-analyzer).

Three technical IBMers, woohoo! I am so excited to meet them in person. 

(I hope they donâ€™t mind I use their pictures here) :grin:

We are going to work with Moroccan Society of Surgery (MSS) and IBM Health Corps team on a web-based software system. This system will analyse medical data, represent results in a dashboard, and help doctors/surgeons to improve their medical practice and surgery quality outcomes. This project is organized and founded by MMS and Lalla Salma Foundation. BTW, I read about Princess Lalla Salma, she is such a brilliant and kind princess!
