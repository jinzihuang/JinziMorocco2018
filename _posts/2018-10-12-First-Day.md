After 7 hours flight from Toronto to Paris, I met other 7 IBMERS in the Charles de Gaulle airport. We hugged, chatted and laughed. All of us were very happy and excite about the coming adventure.

We arrived at Rabat Salé airport around 1 pm. Unfortunately, my checked in luggage wasn't transferred in the same flight with me, which was deferred to the next flight. So, I had to fill a form and  pick it up in person later (they don't delivery).

Salé airport is small but beautiful and quiet, which reminds me the Hawaii Maui airport, small but elegant.

Malika and Mehdi (the Pyxera Global Morocco organizers ) already waited for us in the hotel lobby, and after an half hour car ride, we finally met! Malika and Mehdi are very friendly and warm hearted that made me felt extremely welcomed. Our hotel ONOMO is located in the downtown area of Rabat, the rooms are clean,  modern and have great views.

After everyone arrived at Rabat safely, we went out for our first dinner at "Tajine Wa Tanjia", a Moroccan restaurant that serves traditional food Tajine and Tanjia. The food was delicious, and I ate a lot!! (I guess we all ate too much)

On the way back to the hotel, I was pleased with the cozy breeze. My CSC Morocco is officially started!
