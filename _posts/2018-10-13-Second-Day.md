I had almost 10 hours sleep last night without a single wake up! Ever since Athena was born, I wasn't able to sleep straightly for so many hours. I was well charged and ready for a bright fresh day.

Orientation was held in the hotel's conference room. We reviewed IBM security policy again, and then Malika gave us a presentation about Morocco's history, geography, culture, education, economics and politics. She also told us about the major cities of Morocco, such as Rabat, Marrakesh, Fes and Casablanca. Thie good news is, we already had plans to visit these cities in the following weekends.

After a great Moroccan lunch, we started the afternoon orientation. We installed the Morocco SIN card in our smart phones, and we played some fun games to get more familiar with each other. Then Malika and Mehdi showed us the neighbourhood, such as ATM, laundry room, super marked and so on.

Today's dinner was at a Italian restaurant. The food was amazing, but I was quite surprised that Mehdi drank some wine with us. He told us though Morocco is a Islam country, but people here are very diversity. In Morocco big cities, you can find  bars, club and casinos easily.

It was a busy and fillful day. Tomorrow we will have a Rabat city tour. Looking forward.
