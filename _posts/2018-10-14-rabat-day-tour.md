Today Malika gave us a city tour of Rabat. The first stop was The Chellah. It is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis located in the metro area of Rabat. The Romans and Muslim Arabs built their cities here. Many of the remaining structures in Chellah were damaged by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  The site has been converted to a garden and tourist venue, and today it is included in the metropolitan area of Rabat.

Then we visited Hassan Tower and Mausoleum of Mohammed V. Hassan Tower is the minaret of an incomplete mosque in Rabat. Commissioned by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, the third Caliph of the Almohad Caliphate in 1195, the tower was intended to be the largest minaret in the world along with the mosque, also intended to be the world's largest. When al-Mansur died in 1199, construction on the mosque stopped. The tower reached 44 m (140 ft), about half of its intended 86 m (260 ft) height. The rest of the mosque was also left incomplete, with only the beginnings of several walls and 348 columns being constructed. The Mausoleum of Mohammed V is a mausoleum located on the opposite side of the Hassan Tower, on the Yacoub al-Mansour esplanade in Rabat. It contains the tombs of the Moroccan king and his two sons, late King Hassan II and Prince Abdallah.

After that, we visited Kasbah of the Udayas.  It is a kasbah in Rabat, Morocco. It is located at the mouth of the Bou Regreg river opposite Sal√©. The edifice was built in the 12th century during the reign of the Almohad Caliphate (AD 1121-1269). When the Almohads had captured Rabat and destroyed the kasbah of the Almoravid dynasty in the town, they began reconstructing it in AH 544 / AD 1150. They added a palace and a mosque and named it al-Mahdiyya, after their ancestor al-Mahdi Ibn Tumart. After the death of Yaqub al-Mansur (AH 595 / AD 1199), the kasbah was deserted.

At the end, we took a walk at the beachside. It was such a cold day, and most of us didn't bring and wear enough clothes for this kind of weather.
